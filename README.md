	<strong>This repo contains a working prototype for the next gen agent Jira integration</strong>
</p>


## Overview

This is a working concept prototype for the next generation of the Agent's Jira integration.  It's meant to experiment with some different design choices and to validate some potential architectural decisions.

## Running

You can run like this:

```
agent.next dev . --log-level=debug
```

This will run an export for GitHub and print all the JSON objects to the console.
